# Decentralized Escrow Application on XDC Network for Merchants and Customers

## Problem Statement
In online transactions, trust issues between merchants and customers often lead to disputes and potential fraud. The lack of a reliable escrow service poses a significant challenge.

## Solution
Our project addresses this by creating a decentralized escrow application on the XDC network. It leverages smart contracts and NFTs to ensure secure transactions and funds' safety until services/products are delivered.

## Product
Our application allows merchants to create escrow accounts, generate unique URLs for sharing with customers, and facilitates fund deposits and approval for release post-service/product delivery.

## Tech Stack
- XDC Network
- Solidity (Smart Contracts)
- Web3.js
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)
- MetaMask Integration

## Problems Faced While Building
- Smart Contract Integration: Ensuring seamless interaction between the Escrow and NFT contracts while maintaining security.
- NFT Minting: Managing the uniqueness and association of NFTs with their corresponding escrow accounts.
- Security and Edge Cases: Addressing potential vulnerabilities and edge cases to prevent misuse or exploitation of the system.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Configure MetaMask with XDC Network.
4. Deploy the smart contracts.
5. Run the application.
